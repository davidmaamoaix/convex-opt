# Introduction

## Idea of Optimization

tl;dr: minimizing a function.

### Examples of Optimizations
Regressions:
- Least Squares
- Least Absolute Deviations (robust)

Regularized:
- Lasso (with constraints)

Classifications:
- Logistic Regression
- Range Loss (SVMs)

Others:
- Traveling Salesman
- Planning/Discrete Opt.
- MLE

### Not Optimizations
- Boosting
- Ensembles (Random Forests)
- CV

Outputs itself isn't simply optimal in respect to some criterion.
