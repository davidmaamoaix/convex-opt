	\begin{prop}
		A polyhedron $\{x \in \RR^n : Ax \leq b\}$ for $A \in \RR^{m \times n}$ and $b \in \RR^m$ is both convex and closed.
	\end{prop}
	\begin{proof}
		The polyhedron $P = \{x \in \RR^n : Ax \leq b\}$ can be described as the intersection of $n(P)$ half-spaces, denoted by set $H$:
		\begin{gather*}
			A_{1,1}x_1 + A_{1,2}x_2 + \dots + A_{1,n}x_n \leq  b_1 \\
			\dots \\
			A_{m,1}x_1 + A_{m,2}x_2 + \dots + A_{m,n}x_n \leq  b_m
		\end{gather*}
		
		$\forall a, b \in P$, both $a$ and $b$ are in all of the above half-spaces (by definition of intersection $P \in H_i$ for all $i$), and the line connecting them can be obtained via their convex combination $z(t) = tx + (1-t)y$ for $t \in [0, 1]$. Half-spaces are convex, and therefore for any half-space $H$, $x, y \in H \Rightarrow z(t) \in H$. Since the above is satisfied for all above half-spaces,  $z(t) \in P$ (definition of intersection). Therefore, $P$ satisfies that $x, y \in P \Rightarrow tx + (1-t)y \in P$, proving that $P$ is indeed convex.
		
		The closeness of $P$ can be proven by considering the open set complement $\overline{H_i}$ of every half-space $H_i$. $\bigcup_i \overline{H_i}$ is an open set, and $P = \bigcup_i H_i$ is its complement. Therefore $P$ is a closed set (definition of closeness).
	\end{proof}
	
	\begin{prop}
		Given a set of convex sets $S$, the intersection $\bigcap_i S_i$ is convex. Similarly, given a set of closed sets $S$, the intersection $\bigcap_i S_i$ is closed.
	\end{prop}
	
	\begin{proof}
		The intersection $P = \bigcap_i S_i$ is a subset of every $S_i$ (definition of intersection). For all $x, y \in P, t \in [0, 1]$, $tx + (1-t)y \in S_i$ for all $i$ (definition of convex set). The line $tx + (1-t)y$ is contained in every $S_i$, therefore it is contained in the intersection $P$ of all $S_i$ (definition of intersection).
		
		(Same as \textit{1.1}) The closeness of $P$ can be proven by considering the open set complement $\overline{H_i}$ of every half-space $H_i$. $\bigcup_i \overline{H_i}$ is an open set, and $P = \bigcup_i H_i$ is its complement. Therefore $P$ is a closed set (definition of closeness).
	\end{proof}
	
	\begin{prob}
		Give an example of a closed set in $\RR^2$ whose convex set is not closed.
	\end{prob}
	
	\begin{proof}
		The set of $(x, y)$ satisfying
		\begin{gather*}
			y \geq \frac{1}{x^2 + c}
		\end{gather*}
		where $c \in \RR_+$ is a closed set, while its convex hull is any $(x_c, y_c)$ satisfying $y > 0$ (an open set).
	\end{proof}
